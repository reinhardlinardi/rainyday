		<p id="teamdesc">Once upon a time, three young developers gathered to finish the last task of the 4<sup>th</sup> semester. They formed a team called "Rainy Day", which is a combination of our names: Rachel, Reinhard, and Wenny. The Great Britain has inspired them. It rains even in the summer. This depicts their working environment: they were always calm, even though there is constant tension coming from various deadlines.</p>
